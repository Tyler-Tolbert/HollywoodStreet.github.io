        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p class="lead">We are known simply as <strong>Christians</strong>, members of the body of Christ (Acts 11:26; Ephesians 1:22-23). As a church, congregation, we are known as the church of Christ, the Lord's church or some other scriptural description to identify ourselves as the saved people belonging to Christ (Ephesians 5:23; Romans 16:16).  What to expect when you come worship with us.<br><br>
        Prayer will be offered  (1 Timothy 2:1-4).<br><br>
        Acapella, congregational singing is one feature of worship which God desires. The New Testament teaches us to sing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs to edify each other and glorify God and Christ (Ephesians 5:19; Colossians 3:16).<br><br>
        A sermon will be preached that exalts the Word of God above the will of man. The speaker will point us again and again to the Scriptures as the inerrant, infallible word of God (2 Timothy 3:16, 17). At the conclusion of the sermon, anyone wishing to become a Christian, or Christians desiring the prayers of the church will be given opportunity to do so.<br><br>
        The Lordâ€™s Supper will be offered to all Christians in memory of the death and sacrifice of Jesus Christ (1 Corinthians 11:23-26).<br><br>
        A collection will be taken from our members as a means of supporting our work. Early Christians did this each Sunday, too (1 Corinthians 16:1,2). Visitors are under no obligation whatsoever to contribute to this collection.<br><br>
        We  welcome questions, <strong>so feel free to ask!</strong>  We  believe in giving a Bible answer for a Bible question!<br><br></p>

              <p>Bro. Viltz is profound in his preaching, yet practical in his teaching.  He is an advocate for the gospel of Christ.  In an effort to unify faith based clergymen with the law enforcement, Bro. Viltz has completed a Cops and Clergy Program with the East Baton Rouge Police Department/City.  He is married to the former Nivea D. Joiner of Lafayette, Louisiana.  They have three children Nijah Nicole, Aaron Nicholas and Reese Nikhil.</p>
              <p>His Favorite Scripture is I Peter 4:11 "If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whombe praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen"</p>
